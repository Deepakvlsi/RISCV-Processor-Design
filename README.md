## 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V Processor

This project implements a 32-bit, 5-stage pipelined processor based on the RISC-V RV32I instruction set architecture, including instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages. It also integrates control logic and forwarding mechanisms to handle data hazards efficiently.

ðŸ“Œ Features  

âœ… RISC-V RV32I Base Instruction Set

âœ… 5-stage pipeline: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB

âœ… Data forwarding for hazard mitigation (based on Figure 7.55)

âœ… Hazard detection unit (for load-use hazard stalls)

âœ… Pipeline registers between each stage

âœ… Control unit generating control signals based on instruction decoding

âœ… Written in Verilog HDL
